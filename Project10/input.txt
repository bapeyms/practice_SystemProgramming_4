Often we hear, learn, and even use terms or phrases that we dont fully understand. 
I find this to be quite common within the software development community, whether is be RESTful Web APIs, Agile methodology, Machine Learning, or some other term. 
This isnt necessarily a bad thing, but its important to understand when you truly know something and when you just know the name for it.
For me, Systems Programming is one such term. Id like to try and explain, using simple language, what this means.
The article goes on to imply that a core part of system programming is the need for things to be very fast.
This makes sense why we would need to know a lot about the hardware. 
It also makes sense that speed (performance) would be a core part of systems programming if it is a platform to other software.
If the most central part of your application (the system software “platform”) is slow, then the whole application is slow. 
For many applications, especially at scale, this would be a deal-breaker.
